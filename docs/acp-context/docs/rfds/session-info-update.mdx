title: "Session Info Update"
---

- Author(s): [@ignatov](https://github.com/ignatov)

## Elevator pitch

Add a `session_info_update` variant to the existing `SessionUpdate` notification type that allows agents to update session metadata (particularly title/name), enabling dynamic session identification in client UIs without requiring a new endpoint.

## Status quo

Currently, the ACP protocol provides session management through `session/new`, `session/load`, and `session/list` (unstable). The `session/list` endpoint returns `SessionInfo` objects that include an optional `title` field for displaying session names in client UIs.

However, there are several problems:

1. **No way to communicate title updates** - The `title` field in `SessionInfo` is static in the list response. Agents cannot dynamically update it as the session evolves.

2. **No mechanism for real-time metadata updates** - Unlike commands (`available_commands_update`) or modes (`current_mode_update`), there's no way for agents to:
   - Auto-generate titles after the first meaningful exchange
   - Update titles as conversation context shifts
   - Provide custom metadata that reflects session state

3. **Inconsistent with protocol patterns** - Other dynamic session properties use `session/update` notifications (commands, modes, plans), but metadata has no equivalent mechanism.

The current workaround is for clients to:

- Maintain their own title mapping (doesn't persist or sync)
- Only show static metadata from `session/list`
- Have no way to receive agent-generated titles in real-time

## What we propose to do about it

Add a new `session_info_update` variant to the existing `SessionUpdate` discriminated union that allows agents to notify clients about metadata changes. This update would:

1. **Follow the existing `SessionUpdate` pattern**:
   - Uses the same notification mechanism as `available_commands_update`, `current_mode_update`, etc.
   - Sent via `session/update` method
   - Agent-initiated, no request/response needed

2. **Align with `SessionInfo` structure**:
   - Contains the same fields as `SessionInfo` from `session/list`
   - All fields are optional (partial updates)
   - Enables incremental metadata updates
   - **Important**: `SessionInfoUpdate` must stay aligned with `SessionInfo` - when new fields are added to `SessionInfo`, they should also be added to `SessionInfoUpdate` as optional fields

3. **Support common use cases**:
   - Agent auto-generates title after first prompt
   - Agent updates title as conversation context shifts
   - Agent provides custom metadata for client features (tags, status, etc.)
   - User explicitly requests title change (agent responds with update notification)

4. **Integrate seamlessly**:
   - No new capability required (uses existing `session/update` mechanism)
   - Compatible with `session/list` - metadata should persist and be reflected in list responses
   - Works during active sessions

### Notification Structure

The agent sends a `session/update` notification with `sessionUpdate: "session_info_update"`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "update": {
      "sessionUpdate": "session_info_update",
      "title": "Implement user authentication",
      "_meta": {
        "tags": ["feature", "auth"],
        "priority": "high"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### SessionInfoUpdate Type

The update type mirrors `SessionInfo` but with all fields optional:

```typescript
{
  sessionUpdate: "session_info_update",
  title?: string | null,           // Update or clear the title
  updatedAt?: string | null,        // ISO 8601 timestamp (usually agent sets this)
  _meta?: object | null             // Custom metadata (merged with existing)
}
```

**Note:** `sessionId` and `cwd` are NOT included since:

- `sessionId` is already in the notification's `params`
- `cwd` is immutable and set during `session/new`

### Examples

#### Update title and working directory metadata

After the user sends their first meaningful prompt, the agent can generate and send a title along with metadata about the working directory:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "update": {
      "sessionUpdate": "session_info_update",
      "title": "Debug authentication timeout",
      "_meta": {
        "projectName": "api-server",
        "branch": "main"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Update title as conversation evolves

As the conversation shifts focus:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "update": {
      "sessionUpdate": "session_info_update",
      "title": "Debug authentication timeout → Add retry logic"
    }
  }
}
```

## Shiny future

Once this feature exists:

1. **Dynamic session identification** - Agents can:
   - Auto-generate meaningful titles from conversation content
   - Update titles as conversations evolve
   - Provide rich metadata for better organization

2. **Improved client UIs** - Clients can:
   - Show real-time title updates in session lists
   - Display session status, tags, or other metadata
   - Update UI immediately without polling `session/list`

3. **Consistent protocol patterns** - Session metadata updates work like other dynamic session properties (commands, modes), creating a unified model

4. **Bidirectional workflows** - Combined with a potential future request method:
   - User renames session → client sends request → agent acknowledges with `session_info_update` notification
   - Agent auto-generates title → sends `session_info_update` notification → client displays it

5. **Enhanced use cases**:
   - Session templates that auto-set titles and tags
   - Progress indicators via `_meta`
   - Integration with external tools via metadata
   - Rich session browsing and filtering

## Implementation details and plan

### Phase 1: Schema Changes

1. **Update `schema.unstable.json`**:
   - Add `SessionInfoUpdate` type definition
   - Add new variant to `SessionUpdate` oneOf array
   - Align fields with `SessionInfo` but make all optional

```json
{
  "SessionInfoUpdate": {
    "description": "**UNSTABLE**\n\nThis capability is not part of the spec yet, and may be removed or changed at any point.\n\nUpdate to session metadata. All fields are optional to support partial updates.",
    "properties": {
      "_meta": {
        "description": "Extension point for implementations"
      },
      "title": {
        "description": "Human-readable title for the session",
        "type": ["string", "null"]
      },
      "updatedAt": {
        "description": "ISO 8601 timestamp of last activity",
        "type": ["string", "null"]
      }
    },
    "type": "object"
  }
}
```

Add to `SessionUpdate` oneOf:

```json
{
  "allOf": [
    {
      "$ref": "#/$defs/SessionInfoUpdate"
    }
  ],
  "description": "**UNSTABLE**\n\nThis capability is not part of the spec yet, and may be removed or changed at any point.\n\nUpdate to session metadata",
  "properties": {
    "sessionUpdate": {
      "const": "session_info_update",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": ["sessionUpdate"],
  "type": "object"
}
```

### Phase 2: Protocol Documentation

2. **Create documentation** in `/docs/protocol/session-metadata.mdx`:
   - Explain the notification mechanism
   - Provide examples of common patterns
   - Document merge semantics for `_meta`
   - Clarify relationship with `session/list`

3. **Update existing docs**:
   - Reference in `/docs/protocol/session-setup.mdx`
   - Add to `/docs/protocol/prompt-turn.mdx` session update section

### Phase 3: SDK Implementation

4. **Implement in Rust SDK**:
   - Add `SessionInfoUpdate` struct
   - Add variant to `SessionUpdate` enum
   - Update notification handling in agent and client traits
   - Add helper methods for common patterns

5. **Implement in TypeScript SDK** (if applicable):
   - Add TypeScript types
   - Update notification handlers
   - Add helper methods

### Phase 4: Example Implementation

6. **Update example agents**:
   - Demonstrate auto-generating title from first prompt
   - Show updating metadata during session
   - Example of using `_meta` for custom fields

### Compatibility Considerations

- **Fully backward compatible**: This adds a new notification variant to an existing mechanism
- **No breaking changes**: Existing agents and clients continue working
- **Graceful degradation**: Clients that don't handle this notification simply ignore it
- **No new capability needed**: Uses existing `session/update` infrastructure

### Design Decisions

**Why notification instead of request/response?**

- Consistent with existing `SessionUpdate` patterns (`available_commands_update`, `current_mode_update`)
- Agents initiate updates based on conversation state
- Simpler than bidirectional request/response
- Enables real-time updates without polling

**Why make all fields optional?**

- Allows partial updates (only update what changed)
- More efficient - don't resend unchanged data
- Flexible for different use cases
- Mirrors partial update patterns in other protocols

**Why not include `sessionId` and `cwd` in the update?**

- `sessionId` is already in the notification params
- `cwd` is immutable (set in `session/new`, never changes)
- Keeps update focused on mutable metadata

**How do `_meta` updates work?**

- **Merge semantics**: New `_meta` fields are merged with existing ones
- To clear a specific field: `"_meta": { "fieldName": null }`
- To clear all custom metadata: `"_meta": null`

### Security Considerations

- **No additional security concerns**: Uses existing session authentication
- **Input validation**:
  - Agents should validate title length (recommend 500 chars max)
  - Sanitize metadata to prevent injection
  - Validate `_meta` structure based on agent requirements
- **Resource limits**: Agents should limit update frequency and metadata size

## Frequently asked questions

### Why not create a new endpoint like `session/update-metadata`?

The notification pattern is more appropriate because:

1. **Consistency**: Other dynamic session properties (commands, modes) use notifications
2. **Agent-initiated**: Agents typically generate titles from conversation context
3. **Real-time**: No request/response overhead, updates flow naturally
4. **Simpler**: Reuses existing `session/update` infrastructure

### How does this work with `session/list`?

The updated metadata should persist and be reflected in subsequent `session/list` calls. The notification provides real-time updates to connected clients, while `session/list` provides the current state for discovery.

### Can clients trigger title updates?

This RFD covers agent-initiated updates. Client-initiated updates could work by:

1. Client sends a prompt asking to rename session
2. Agent updates its internal state
3. Agent sends `session_info_update` notification
4. Client receives and displays the update

A future RFD could add explicit request/response for this if needed.

### What if multiple updates are sent in quick succession?

Clients should apply updates incrementally in order. Each notification represents a delta, not a full replacement (except for fields explicitly set to `null`).

### Should `updatedAt` be automatically set by the agent?

Yes, typically the agent should update this timestamp when any session activity occurs, not just when metadata changes. However, including it in `session_info_update` allows agents to explicitly control it if needed.

### Do agents need a new capability for this?

No. All agents that support `session/update` notifications can send this variant. Clients that don't recognize it will ignore it (standard JSON-RPC behavior).

### How does this interact with `session/fork`?

When forking, the parent session's metadata could be copied (implementation choice). The forked session would have its own `sessionId` and could receive separate `session_info_update` notifications.

### What happens if title is too long?

This is an implementation choice. Agents MAY:

- Truncate long titles
- Reject updates (though this is a notification, so no error response)
- Set a reasonable limit (e.g., 500 characters)

Clients SHOULD handle long titles gracefully (truncate in UI, show tooltip, etc.).

### Can `_meta` have nested objects?

Yes, `_meta` is an arbitrary object. Agents define its structure. The merge semantics apply recursively - nested objects are merged, not replaced entirely.

### What alternative approaches did you consider, and why did you settle on this one?

Several alternatives were considered:

1. **Add a new request/response endpoint (`session/update-metadata`)** - This would be inconsistent with how other dynamic session properties (commands, modes) are handled. The notification pattern is more appropriate for agent-initiated updates.

2. **Add title parameter to `session/new`** - Only allows setting title at creation time, doesn't support dynamic updates as the conversation evolves.

3. **Client-side only metadata tracking** - Doesn't work across devices, can get out of sync, and duplicates storage. This is the current workaround and has significant limitations.

4. **Generic `session/update` request for all properties** - Could conflict with immutable properties (sessionId, cwd) and has unclear semantics about what can be updated.

The proposed notification-based approach:

- **Consistent** with existing protocol patterns
- **Flexible** for both agent-initiated and user-initiated updates
- **Simple** to implement and understand
- **Extensible** via `_meta` field
